Contains My vim configuration

I may list all the contents in near future till then check out the names of plugins yourself .



The shortcut keys of most plugins are given in .vimrc file.

Place the .vimrc file and  .vim folder in your home Directory.


This needs "vim" ,not the default "vi" that comes with most distribution.
